> In consideration of public safety around the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, we have decided to cancel the physical #DLXSA2020 event. However, in the spirit of keeping the ML fire burning, a series of online talks were hosted.

A Deep Learning IndabaX is a locally-organised Deep Learning Indaba conference that helps ensure that knowledge and capacity in machine learning are spread more widely across the African continent. As a community-driven off-shoot of the Deep Learning Indaba, the events are typically organised by students and young researchers passionate about the field and its growth. Since 2018, 39 IndabaX events have been organized in different countries across Africa, growing the community by over 2,000 attendees. Collaborating with IndabaX events across the continent, the upcoming event is the only one in South Africa, and the biggest with at least 200 attendees each year.

The aim of the conference is to provide a practical introduction to machine learning for beginners, to exchange scientific knowledge amongst researchers, and showcase cutting-edge applications from industry partners (these will be in parallel sessions). Furthermore, there will be a poster session to showcase student research, an online hackathon for country engagement, and an "unconference" session to promote an attendee-driven agenda.
