## About

The Indabaùïè 2021 will be held in the form of a **Roadshow**. The roadshow takes place from 3 September - 26 November and offers a **series of events, each of which is hosted by a different team of local organisers and/or institutions**. The local teams design the content of the event in close collaboration with the main IndabaX organising committee. The events can take the form of a lab showcase, hackathon, industry panel, student talks, ML pub quiz, or any other engaging, fun and informative activity.
¬†
An equally important second pillar is the growth of a decentralised [**IndabaX South Africa community forum**](http://eepurl.com/hCE_C5), where everyone can sign up and interact with each other. The space is a safe peer-to-peer platform for aspiring and seasoned South African machine learning enthusiasts to exchange knowledge, search for help, recruit talent and build an inclusive culture around data and ML. The forum will be moderated by experienced machine learning volunteers, who will staff dedicated **office hours once a week** for the duration of the road show. In these office hours, forum members can post questions (from ‚ÄúWhat do I need to study to become a machine learning expert?‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow do I train a RNN in PyTorch?‚Äú and ‚ÄúWhere can I find a supervisor for a PhD investigating generalisation bounds in a PAC learning framework?‚Äù), and the experts will try to offer support - which may sometimes just be to forward the question to the right colleague.

The third pillar of the IndabaX 2021 Roadshow is a **competition in which participants can win monetary or material prizes**. The competition will have different categories in which candidates can submit their past ML and data-based research projects. It will conclude at the end of the second month, and participants can actively use the forum for help with their submissions. The finale of the Roadshow will announce the winners, and thereby conclude the event.
