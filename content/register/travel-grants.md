We have some travel grants available for **South African students** which must be applied for [_during the application process_](/register/now).

<!--more-->

We have some South African government funding available for fellowships so a select number of students can have their regional (within South Africa) transport and accommodation funded. The organising committee will organise major transport and accommodation only. 

We will fund the most reasonable form of transportation that balances accessibility to the conference and economic expense. I.e., a bus may be the only appropriate option if flights are particularly expensive as flights for everyone may limit how many people we can fund and thus reduce accessibility of the conference.

Note that in the case of flights, transport to and from airports are at one's own expense.

Accommodation may be in a shared (single gender) dorm.
