## Talks and Posters

**we encourage unpublished and already published work alike**

**For 2022, we are currently only considering in-person presentations**

### Presentation format

#### Talks

We welcome submissions for flash talks (\~ 5 min), short talks (\~25 min), and long talks (\~40 min). If your abstract is accepted, we will communicate with you what length format works best, considering your submitted preferences and our requirements.

#### Posters

Please view this video for an example on how to improve your poster design [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58") \[adjust the template to your own needs!\]

### Submission format

This form includes space to submit your research for a talk and/or poster.
You should have the following items prepared:
(1) title
(2) author list (including email addresses of all authors), and
(3) EITHER two-page PDF OR an existing publication.

Accepted talks will have their fees waived if applicable, but speakers are expected to make their own way to the Indabaùïè. Accepted posters have the same fee.
The Indabaùïè is NOT a "pay-to-speak" affair. Sponsors and speakers are independently organised, but can overlap.

**Published work**
We welcome the submission of published work for a talk or poster.

**Unpublished work**
Abstracts will be evaluated on the basis of a two page (A4 or US Letter) submission in PDF format.
This two-page PDF should contain:

1. Clear title - 100 characters or fewer (including spaces), capitalized in sentence case
2. 300-word Summary - brief description of the study's primary findings, emphasising their significance, generality, novelty and relevance. You will be asked to copy this 300-word summary into a text-only box; it will be included in the Indabaùïè program if your submission is accepted.
   Additional Detail - use the remaining space to expand upon the central question(s), approach, results, and/or conclusions of the study. You may include equations as appropriate. Figures are optional. You need not touch upon all the major points of the Summary, but should aim to include whatever detail will best help reviewers to evaluate the significance of your study. Do not feel obliged to fill the entire two pages.

Font size (including any figure legends) must be at least 12 point. Margins should be at least 0.5". This two-page PDF will be the only document seen by reviewers. (Abstracts exceeding two pages will have additional pages removed). Submissions that do not meet these guidelines may be rejected.

### Evaluation Criteria

PDF submissions will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:

* Significance
* Originality
* Clarity
* Relevance
  The submission should clearly explain why your question is important and how your claims will advance the field. Include enough detail that reviewers can assess the technical content of your methods and results. Please be sure to address the significance and fit of your submission for the audience, which includes a mix of academics and industry interested in the functional properties of deep learning and machine learning.

Double-blind - The reviewing process will be double-blind at the level of reviewers. Authors are responsible for anonymizing their submission. In particular, do not include author names, author affiliations, or acknowledgements in the abstract or body of the submission and avoid providing any other identifying information in text or figures. A double-blind review may not be completely possible for published works, but attempts will be made to anonymise the process.
