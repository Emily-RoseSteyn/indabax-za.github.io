We welcome one and all to the much awaited üé§ **AI FEST** üñºÔ∏è - a one-night-only affair to showcase the present and future of AI from students, companies, and research labs. Registration opening soon.

<!-- If you would like to **register** just for the AI Fest, use the link below &darr; -->

We welcome posters from students, booths or exhibitions from companies, showcasing research from research labs.

## Posters

**Every attendee can bring a poster to the Indabaùïè!** It is a good idea to indicate you will be bringing one during the application/registration process so we can provide adequate space.

Posters are a great way to learn, share, and get feedback on your work in a helpful and friendly environment.
The project does not have to be "done", in fact, it's probably more beneficial that your poster is on a work-in-progress project for something that you would like expert advice on.
For posters, we also welcome submissions on a topic or interest that you are passionate about but may not have results on.

Take the opportunity. You can also win prizes üèÜ!

We recommend preparing an A1 landscape poster. Download a template [here](https://osf.io/6ua4k "https://osf.io/6ua4k").

Please view this video for an example on how to improve your poster design [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58") \[adjust the template to your own needs!\]

## Booths and exhibitions

More details will be announced soon.
