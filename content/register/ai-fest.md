### Poster Sessions  🗒️

Posters are a great way to learn, share, and get feedback on your work in a helpful and friendly environment.
The project does not have to be "done", in fact, it's probably more beneficial that your poster is on a work-in-progress project for something that you would like expert advice on.
For posters, we also welcome submissions on a topic or interest that you are passionate about but may not have results on.

Take the opportunity. You can also win prizes 🏆!

Please view this video for an example on how to improve your poster design [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RwJbhkCA58") \[adjust the template to your own needs!\]
