## Tips

Here are some tips to strengthen your next application:

- Show that you are committed to learning more about machine learning. For example, if you've taken an online course (such as Andrew Ng's Coursera course) you should mention it (and if you haven't we would highly recommend doing so).
- Talk about how you are already using, or how you plan to use, machine learning for your work or research.
- Talk about how you are contributing to your local machine learning community. For example, do you organize meetup events, run lectures, or lead a study group?
- Make sure you put plenty of effort into the application since this is one way for us to judge your interest in attending.
