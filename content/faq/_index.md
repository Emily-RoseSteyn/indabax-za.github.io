## Funding

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-brazilian-real-sign">}} &nbsp; **How much does it cost to _attend_ the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

The Indaba𝕏 is free to attend if you applied and are accepted. There are [paid registration options](/register) for academics and industry professionals.

Speakers have their fees waived.

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-sack-dollar">}} &nbsp; **How much does it cost the Indaba𝕏 per person?** {.faq-item}

Each person we have at the event costs the Indaba𝕏 ~R1750. Considering we have 400 people, this is a lot of money. We are very grateful to our [partners](/partners) for making this possible.

As a community-orientated event, we are committed to making the Indaba𝕏 as accessible as possible. We have a number of travel grants available to help people attend the Indaba𝕏. These are allocated at **application time**. See [/register/travel-grants/](/register/travel-grants/) for more.

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-piggy-bank">}} &nbsp; **Can I get funding to attend the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

We have a limited number of travel grants that have awarded to applicants. These are allocated at **application time**. See [/register/travel-grants/](/register/travel-grants/) for more.

One of the hardest decisions we make is allocating finite resources to infinite passion. We wish we could fund everyone, but we can't. We are very grateful to our [partners](/partners) for making any of this possible.

If you **need** funding to attend, but did not get one this year, the best thing you can do is to apply again next year. We will be around and rotating the event across our beautiful country, and we will be trying our best to make the Indaba𝕏 as accessible as possible.

#### {{<icon "ti-infinite">}} &nbsp; **How can I support the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

If you are an organisation, consider [partnering](/partner) with us to gain more visibility and support the Indaba𝕏. If you are an individual, attending through [paid registration options](/register) is also beneficial. If you are feeling particularly benevolent, consider [donating](https://www.payfast.co.za/donate/go/deeplearningindabaxsouthafricanpc).

Additionally, consider helping organise the event, volunteering at the event, shouting about the event, or just being a good human being.

## Food

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-mug-saucer">}} &nbsp; **Will there be tea and coffee?** {.faq-item}

Yes, there will be tea and coffee available at certain times throughout the day!

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-utensils">}} &nbsp; **Will there be food?** {.faq-item}

<!-- If you have an "Accommodation" travel grant (you will know this explicitly), we provide breakfast for you on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th of July. -->

Each **evening** will have an activity with some food and drinks provided, but in limited quantities and not intended as a full dinner experience. We **strongly** encourage you to make friends and go explore the city for dinner.

## Safety

#### {{<icon "ti-alert">}} &nbsp; **Is Johannesburg safe?** {.faq-item}

Johannesburg is a beautiful city, but like any city, it has its problems. We recommend that you take the same precautions as you would in any other city.

The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) has security guards on campus.

## Time

#### {{<icon "fa-solid fa-clock">}} &nbsp; **When should I arrive/leave Johannesburg for the Indaba𝕏?** {.faq-item}

We suggest arriving the day before the Indaba𝕏 starts (i.e. the 8th of July) and leaving the day after the Indaba𝕏 ends (i.e. the 13th of July).

#### {{<icon "ti-bag">}} &nbsp; **How packed is the schedule?** {.faq-item}

Very. We have an awesome selection of speakers and activities to fill up the time from ~8:30 am until 5 pm and beyond each day. The evening activities are normally optional, but we highly recommend you attend them for the full experience. Remember to take time for yourself, and to explore the city and surrounds.

See more on the [schedule](/schedule) page (updated over time).
