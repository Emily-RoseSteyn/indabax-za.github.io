A Deep Learning IndabaX is a locally-organised Deep Learning Indaba conference 
that helps ensure that knowledge and capacity in machine learning are spread more widely 
across the African continent. As a community-driven off-shoot of the Deep Learning Indaba,
the events are typically organised by students and young researchers passionate about the 
field and its growth. Since 2018, 39 IndabaX events have been organized in different 
countries across Africa, growing the community by over 2,000 attendees.
