We're serious about growing machine learning in South Africa, no joke!

## The Indabaùïè 2024 organising committee

<!-- add committee details in the 'people' front matter-->
{{< people >}}

---

## Some of our visions for 2024 include:

Get more industry people involved - I believe the economy can benefit from more people starting businesses in AI. Bringing industry leaders to inspire and educate our future AI business owners seems like a good move for the benefit of Africa.

Create spaces for different groups of people to engage (across disciplines, age groups, etc). Perhaps make it more accessible for high school students from under-resourced communities to inspire them to learn more about machine learning and possibly study a related discipline in the future.

Expand the diversity of the ML community in SA

Get more postgraduates  students involved in Poster presentations

Raise lots of money for IndabaX SA to help grow ML communities across the country

Increase the amount of awareness and engagement around the ethics and safety of AI development.

Enable an environment for meaningful connections and inspire young academics to pursue research in machine learning and AI.

Reach out to companies in the tech industry or those with a focus on machine learning and AI.

To reach as many students as possible in all corners of South Africa

Ensure every person that attends feels like they've learnt something valuable

To help build a future where tech empowers individuals and transforms society for the better

Create a deeper focus on AI Safety in Africa

Focusing on entry-level programmers at the hackathon, make it bigger and louder.  Add a game or something casual in ML hackathon‚Ä¶. Maybe have a full night??

To increase the impact of machine learning in africa through rigorous publicity on social media

Reach as many people and tell them about progress from Africa

Grow the next generation of ML experts in SA, help prospective students find their research supervisors, help academics find practical applications and funding in the industry, help the industry benefit from the cutting edge research done in SA. Break the silos! ML for all!

Encouraging active participation from women, youth, marginalized communities, and individuals from various backgrounds in the African AI community to foster inclusivity and diversity.

To promote Machine Learning as a tool which can be used to foster innovation

Get more people excited about ML ü•≥üòé

To have major capacity and impact of ML to the world -

To promote ML literacy by advocating for inclusive education programs and engaging with policymakers to establish ethical and regulatory frameworks while advocating for fairness and accountability in ML algorithms.

Building bridges, driving impact. To unite diverse voices in ML through education and collaboration. To empower individuals and communities to shape a more innovative and inclusive future.

Foster innovation with Machine Learning

Expose young and upcoming researchers to the amazing research opportunities at the intersection of academia and industry!

Have more first time attendees than before.

Empowering the new generation of innovators across Africa to utilise emerging technologies in a way that can uplift humanity and transform industries.

More posters!

Get many people working in AI to showcase their work!"

Diverse voices!

To make  IndabaX 2024 a milestone event that will be looked back upon as a turning point for AI in Africa, where we didn‚Äôt just follow global trends, but set them.

Increase awareness on upskilling and applications resources

To promote the Machine Learning field. Appreciation of Mathematics as a language of science and innovation in this information age.

Create awareness and contribute to capacity building in the field of DS/AI
