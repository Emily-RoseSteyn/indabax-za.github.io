    topic: Everything you need to know about transformers
    talk_description: |-
      The transformer architecture introduced in 2017 has significantly impacted the deep learning field. 
      This tutorial will cover the transformer in great detail so that you can: explain it to your CEO, 
      train a fellow machine learning engineer, maintain a conversation with a seasoned transformer researcher. 
      We will also do deep dives into the transformer topics that get ignored most often.
    bio: |- 
      I am co-founder and a technical lead at ByteFuse, 
      a new startup focusing on developing multimodal algorithms applied to search and optimisation tasks. 
      I can claim that I am officially an university dropout that pursued a company, 
      and I have an unhealthy obsession with cats and llamas.
