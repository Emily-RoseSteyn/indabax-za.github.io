      In an age of surveillance capitalism, anchoring the design of
      emerging smart services in trustworthiness is urgent and important. Edge Intelligence,
      which brings together the fields of AI and Edge computing, is a key enabling technology
      for smart services. Trustworthy Edge Intelligence should thus be a priority research
      concern. However, determining what makes Edge Intelligence trustworthy is not

      in voice-activated services, focusing on interactions between bias, privacy and

      Adaptive learning rates are usually resolved by selecting a learning
      rate or learning rate schedule a priori. Gradient-only optimization provides a
      perspective on resolving learning rates using line searches. Mini-batch sub-sampling
      in the context of line searches requires additional care. A decision can be made
      to keep a mini-batch fixed for the duration of a line search (static mini-batch
      sampling) or it can be continuously updated (dynamic mini-batch sampling). The
      latter result in a point-wise discontinuous loss function, while the former result
      in a continuous and often smooth loss function, depending on the characteristics
      of the activation functions. Gradient-only optimization provides a perspective
      on resolving learning rates for point-wise discontinuous dynamic mini-batch sub-sampled
      loss functions.

      This talk will address the data format and archiving/compession
      issues for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). One of the major contributors to
      the large data volumes is the maximum baseline of an array since it sets how well
      the data needs to be sampled to avoid smearing and decorrelation of the signal.
      Now, the sampling rate is dependent on the baseline length as shorter baselines
      can be sampled a lot more coarsely which leads to smaller data volumes. In fact,
      baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) is an established technique for compressing
      radio interferometric data, however, this technique results in irregularly sampled
      data which while supported by the database format requires the data to be restructured
      in ways that reduce performance when processing. But more importantly, radio-astronomy
      software tools implicitly assume uniformly sampled datasets. Recent research in
      M. Atemkeng, in prep. in collaboration with the Wits University and SARAO; shows
      an approach that uses local  low-rank matrix approximation to achieve similar
      compression rates while significantly minimising smearing.

      Reinforcement Learning has achieved promising results in a wide
      range of sequential decision problems, such as healthcare applications, robotics

      Learning, in which external information is transferred to the agent, for example
      in the form of advice offered by a domain expert. This talk serves as an introduction

      \ time value. The time series is processed by means of Bourdet derivative analysis,\
      \ the derivative with respect to the natural logarithm of time is calculated and\
      \ smoothed using a log-cycle fraction and plotted on a log-log scale. The changes\
      \ in slope of the plotted curve describes the behaviour of the groundwater flow\
      \ in the borehole and the surrounding aquifer(s) during the pumping test. Which\
      \ allows the aquifer system to be classified, and an appropriate technique can\
      \ be selected to determine the aquifer parameters. \n\nHowever, pumping test analysis\
      \ is complex, and in many regards the interpretation resembles an art more than\
      \ a science. Which is further complicated by a lack of validation, there is no\
      \ sensible way to validate the interpretation of pumping tests without destroying\
      \ the aquifer in question. As a result, synthetic data was produced by means of\
      \ numerical groundwater flow models for training. This task is performed visually\
      \ by a hydrogeologist and relies on pattern matching and the relationships between\
      \ the observed features and the time encountered. Due to large variations in the\
      \ value range of the raw data, as well as the sensitivity of the derivative to\
      \ noise, a multiclass image classification approach is investigated utilizing\
      \ a residual neural network as part of this ongoing research."

      Reinforcement learning has achieved recent success in a number
      of difficult, high-dimensional environments. However, these methods generally
      require millions of samples from the environment to learn optimal behaviours,
      limiting their real-world applicability. Hence this work is aimed at creating
      a principled framework for lifelong agents to learn essential skills and be able
      to combine them to solve new compositional tasks without further learning. To
      achieve this, we design useful representations of skills for each task and we
      construct a Boolean algebra over the set of tasks and skills. This enables us
      to compose learned skills to immediately solve new tasks that are expressible
      as a logical composition of past tasks. We present theoretical guarantees for
      our framework and demonstrate its usefulness for lifelong learning via a number
      of experiments.

      Using attribution techniques such as Grad-CAM we aim to understand
      how a group of end-to-end computer vision models can control the steering of a
      vehicle. These models take in forward facing video frames and return an approximated
      steering angle to control the vehicle (The basic example of such an AI system).
      We have constructed a system which then analyses the attribution heat maps against
      segmentation maps of the same input frames to extract semantic information. We
      are then able to produce a statistical value for how often an particular object
      in the frame has an appreciable impact on the steering angle or result of the
      model.

      Unsupervised learning techniques differs from supervised learning
      methods in that they require no target classifications in the data on which they
      are trained. This greatly increases their area of useful application. This talk
      will be introducing unsupervised learning, with a special focus on self-organising
      maps (SOMs). The talk will demonstrate how SOMs are useful for their typical use-case
      of exploratory data analysis. Finally, it will be demonstrated that SOMs can also
      be used for data mining exercises such as rule extraction, making them a useful
      tool to serve as a basis for several different data analysis tasks.

      "Due to the ever-growing complex environments in which reinforcement\
      \ learning algorithms are used, researchers and machine learning engineers are\
      \ encountering the \"curse of dimensionality\" within the state and action space.\
      \ The \"curse of dimensionality\" leads to agents performing below an ideal level\
      \ and increases the time required to train these agents. In this talk a framework\
      \ and algorithm are proposed that use environmental confounding factors to reduce\
      \ the environment and state space complexity, thereby mitigating against the effect\
      \ of the curse of dimensionality. \n\nThis will be demonstrated on a practical\
      \ application within the energy sector, namely the peak load shaving problem.\
      \ The objective of this problem is to reduce the peak amount of energy drawn from\
      \ a grid by sequentially manipulating a linked battery's output. Optimising this\
      \ application in the energy sector can help align a consumer's financial goals\
      \ with creating a sustainable energy future, which is crucial for our environment\
