  topic: Everything you need to know about transformers
  talk_description: "The transformer architecture introduced in 2017 has significantly
    impacted the deep learning field. \nThis tutorial will cover the transformer in
    great detail so that you can: explain it to your CEO, \ntrain a fellow machine
    learning engineer, maintain a conversation with a seasoned transformer researcher.
    \nWe will also do deep dives into the transformer topics that get ignored most
    often."
