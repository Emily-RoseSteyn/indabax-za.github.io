      "The talk will explore the evolution of machine learning and explain the background of the impact of deep learning in modern artificial intelligence. The talk will start by introducing basic 'linear/shallow' approaches to machine learning. The discussion will begin with the traditional reliance on carefully hand-engineered features. We will then delve into the power of deep learning's representation learning. Attendees will discover how deep learning models automatically extract and optimise the most relevant features from raw data, revolutionising fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and beyond. We will end our talk by exploring the persistent challenges and what cutting-edge research is needed to overcome these."

      "A recent report issued by the WWF states that there has been a catastrophic decline in wildlife population in recent years. A large number of species are threatened with extinction due to a number of factors such as over-exploitation of resources, deforestation and climate change. Certain species have been placed on the IUCN Red List for several years, but further conservation efforts are still urgently required to ensure the survival of the remaining individuals. While it is true that the number of individuals in threatened populations is decreasing, there have been considerable conservation efforts to put a halt to this. Ecologists, researchers, and rangers closely monitor the populations, in certain cases by placing microphones, camera-traps, and other sensors into the environment and searching through the recorded data for the species of interest. These data collection methodologies comes with a cost, in that huge datasets (audio, image, accelerometery) are produced and are difficult to manually process. This keynote will discuss our group's efforts in using deep learning to monitor critically endangered species in Africa and around our planet, and hopefully encourage you to do the same."

    talk_description:
      "While reinforcement learning has achieved recent success in many challenging domains, these methods generally require millions of samples from the environment to learn optimal behaviours, limiting their real-world applicability. A major challenge is thus in designing sample-efficient agents that can transfer their existing knowledge to solve new tasks quickly. This is particularly important for agents in a multitask or lifelong setting, since learning to solve complex tasks from scratch is typically impractical. This talk discusses how an agent can autonomously learn a particular family of goal-oriented value functions, which can then be used to solve new tasks through composition. First, for goal-reaching tasks expressible as Boolean sentences, we show how these value functions can be combined to solve these new tasks optimally. We further demonstrate how an agent can combine these value functions to produce near-optimal behaviours given complex temporal task specifications, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic, without further learning."

      "How OSINT leverages on AI and ML to investigate the 'digital mercenaries' who work on behalf of lobbyists or malign foreign states to secretly polarise African societies by seeding hate speech, conspiracist disinformation and extremist content that is designed to undermine public trust in democratic institutions or smear human rights defenders. And how advances in AI can strengthen this work especially in language deficit societies."
