    talk_description:
      "The talk will explore the evolution of machine learning and explain the background of the impact of deep learning in modern artificial intelligence. The talk will start by introducing basic 'linear/shallow' approaches to machine learning. The discussion will begin with the traditional reliance on carefully hand-engineered features. We will then delve into the power of deep learning's representation learning. Attendees will discover how deep learning models automatically extract and optimise the most relevant features from raw data, revolutionising fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and beyond. We will end our talk by exploring the persistent challenges and what cutting-edge research is needed to overcome these."

    talk_description:
      "A recent report issued by the WWF states that there has been a catastrophic decline in wildlife population in recent years. A large number of species are threatened with extinction due to a number of factors such as over-exploitation of resources, deforestation and climate change. Certain species have been placed on the IUCN Red List for several years, but further conservation efforts are still urgently required to ensure the survival of the remaining individuals. While it is true that the number of individuals in threatened populations is decreasing, there have been considerable conservation efforts to put a halt to this. Ecologists, researchers, and rangers closely monitor the populations, in certain cases by placing microphones, camera-traps, and other sensors into the environment and searching through the recorded data for the species of interest. These data collection methodologies comes with a cost, in that huge datasets (audio, image, accelerometery) are produced and are difficult to manually process. This keynote will discuss our group's efforts in using deep learning to monitor critically endangered species in Africa and around our planet, and hopefully encourage you to do the same."

      "In this talk I will cover some of the avenues in Reinforcement Learning that I think are particular interesting and important and are currently being undertaken by my lab."
    bio:
      I am an associate professor in the Department of Maths and Applied Maths at the University of Cape Town and an adjunct professor at the INRS Montreal. Originally from Oxford, England, I completed my PhD at the University of Southampton in 2005, in applications of string theory to understanding quantum chromodynamics. I then had postdoctoral research positions in Beijing, Santiago de Compostela and Munich before becoming a lecturer at the University of Cape Town in the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in 2013. I have a wide array of research interests and spend a lot of my time supervising students. My research interests cover machine learning (in particular reinforcement learning), theoretical physics, and neuroscience.I also love to teach! When not working, I can be found in the kitchen, with my camera, trying to get some exercise or attempting to improve my Mandarin.
