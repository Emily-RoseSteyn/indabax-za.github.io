    talk_description: "Voice conversion aims to transform speech into a target voice with just a few example recordings of the target speaker. Recent methods produce convincing conversions, but at the cost of increased complexity -- making results difficult to reproduce and build on. Instead, in this talk I will go over some of our lab's recent research to keep voice conversion simple by using just the plain k-nearest neighbours algorithm. Despite its simplicity, our recent research is competitive with the largest and complex existing models. I'll also show how it can be used to perform diverse combinations of conversions, such as converting cross-lingually, or between human and animal sounds. "

    talk_description: "We propose a visually grounded speech model that learns new words and their visual depictions from just a few word- image example pairs. Given a set of test images and a spoken query, we ask the model which image depicts the query word. Previous work has simplified this few-shot learning problem by either using an artificial setting with digit word-image pairs or by using a large number of examples per class. Moreover, all previous studies were performed using English speech-image data. We propose an approach that can work on natural word-image pairs but with less examples, i.e. fewer shots, and then illustrate how this approach can be applied for multimodal few-shot learning in a real low-resource language, Yoruba. Our approach involves using the given word-image example pairs to mine new unsupervised word-image training pairs from large collections of unlabelled speech and images. Additionally, we use a word-to-image attention mechanism to determine word-image similarity. With this new model, we achieve better performance with fewer shots than previous approaches on an existing English benchmark. Many of this model’s mistakes are due to relating a few-shot class with its contextual information. We apply multimodal few-shot learning, for the first time, on an actual low-resource language, Yoruba. By initialising the multimodal Yoruba  few-shot model on a larger set of English speech-image data, it can outperform its purely English variant. "

    talk_description: "We are increasingly living in a world that is characterised by the merger and fusing of the digital and physical realms. ChatGPTs recent massive adoption attests to this. Exactly what this merged reality entails is not clear yet, but there is agreement that almost all aspects of our lives are being affected, either directly or indirectly. Recently some notable Computing scholars described the digital-first observation, which is formally defined as an ontological reversal of the digital and physical worlds [1, 2]. More simply described it is the observation that the physical world preceded the digital world before, but we now observe that the digital world precedes (and often prescribes) the physical world. Anybody that traveled recently would have noticed that our biometric-enhanced virtual identity now precedes any physical document - a physical passport is only used for verification and not primarily for identification.  Several more examples of this digital-first reversal can be observed daily if we care to take notice, including that some of the key objects necessary for learning such as books, music, and videos, now exist primarily and firstly in the digital world before they are being realized into physical existence, and then only when it is necessary for human interaction. This presentation will firstly explore the characteristics of digital objects that inevitably resulted in the digital-first world, followed by a discussion of what digital-first means for us. Lastly, some implications and guidelines are proposed for digital literacy living in this new digital-first world."

In practice however, it is typically the case that this posterior distribution is intractable to compute exactly. This tutorial introduces variational inference (VI) - which constructs an approximate posterior by framing the inference problem as an optimization problem. As part of this tutorial, we will consider tools such as Pyro which help simplify the application of VI and allow it to scale to large datasets and models. The tutorial concludes by considering an example application of VI in deep learning - Variational Autoencoders."

We will start by exploring some of the challenges in RL, such as dealing with sparse rewards. To overcome these challenges, researchers investigated adding intrinsic motivation to agents. After defining intrinsic motivation, and its impact within RL, we'll delve into the pivotal role curiosity plays. We will trace the evolution of curiosity algorithms and learn how they act as a driving force for intrinsic motivation. Lastly, we'll showcase cutting-edge research and methodologies that harness curiosity to enhance RL agents' performance. From overcoming challenges to unlocking new possibilities, curiosity opens the door to transformative advancements in RL."

    talk_description: "In the intersection of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Machine Learning (ML), we've embraced a new paradigm for smart network management. SDN, with its unique approach of decoupling the control and data planes, enables a centrally managed system that streamlines traffic flow. But the true breakthrough emerges when we integrate this with ML. This fusion empowers our system to classify encrypted network traffic, master the complexity of expansive networks, and make intelligent, self-regulating decisions. In essence, our framework is redefining network management by combining SDN and ML, delivering improved user experience through intelligent, autonomous networks."

If you are keen to discover what opportunities or potential research collaborations are possible, then join us for our talk.In this part of the talk, Stephanie will touch on the numerous opportunities available at IBM Research, the domains for which we develop technology solutions, including Healthcare, Quantum, AI and Foundation Models. Quantum computing may sound intimidating to some, but, if you have some linear algebra along with a good dose of curiosity in your back pocket, then you are ready to entangle some qubits. Gemma will guide you to resources, events, certifications, and community projects to help you get started in this thrilling field.

With over 15 years of expertise as an accomplished C developer, I have successfully executed the development of portable medium to large-scale projects. My proficiency extends to interfacing low-level C libraries with both interpreted and compiled languages. I possess hands-on experience in implementing various machine learning techniques, ranging from traditional pattern recognition to cutting-edge deep learning, in both research and commercial systems. Additionally, I have extensive knowledge in the application of digital signal processing within commercial-grade software. Throughout my career, I have effectively led small, diverse teams consisting of highly skilled researchers and developers, driving them towards shared objectives. I am the principal architect and engineer behind the Qfrency text-to-speech system, which marks a significant milestone as the first commercial-grade TTS engine capable of synthesising text in all 11 official South African languages. The successful commercialisation of the Qfrency TTS system has facilitated its widespread adoption across various sectors, both domestically and internationally. Notable fields of implementation include education, assistive technologies, call centres, and more."
