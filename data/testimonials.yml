  My key take aways from the conference were in the academia side; I really enjoyed being in the Company of the people I have had around me. They were very intelligent group of People, ranging from the event organizers to the lectures whom shared their years of acquired experience with passion to my fellow students whom were also so accommodating and intelligent. The positive mindset I have acquired from the IndabaX conference was just what I needed to align my personal life with the research project I am currently working on; to know that there are similar minded people out there whom are also working on solving real life problems using science really reenergized me. I thank you kindly for the opportunity.

  I enjoyed meeting different people, who are doing very different from what i do and seeing things from their perspective. The keynote were wildly helpful and interesting, so was the panel discussion. I realized that there is no one straight path in AI and ML and that a lot of us can take very different routes and sort of end up at the same place which is interesting."

  I am an intermediate in research and reinforcement learning with interest in working in industry. Therefore, the whole conference was my key take away in a way. I attended all reinforcement learning related talks, from the foundations to the applied ML and industry. It was interesting how RL was first introduced before moving on to how it is applied. That was thoughtful and accommodating.

  I think the conference did very well when it came to diversity and inclusion, this is highly attributed to the fact that it did not only focus on the technical side of things but included people from different background and cultures with different life experiences. How they came together towards working on solving real life problems really shows the success of this event."
  - content: "
  In terms of people, I think thereâ€™s an even proportion amongst all genders and race. Including applied ML and industry was truly outstanding because not everyone wants to be in research and academia. The talks were so diverse that most industry were included."
